## Chess UI

2D chess UI made with pygame I borrowed from [Plamen](https://github.com/Plamenod/2D_Chess) and hacked to support the project. Removed most of the stuff but the essentials to draw board and handle commands.

## Requirements
 * Python 2.7
 * Pygame for python 2.7
 * Project adhering the IO interface from here: [Chess](https://github.com/poseidon4o/oop-assignment/blob/master/supplementary.md)
